        <p class="big">The 23rd Amendment:</p>
        <div class="smallDiv">
          <p class="small">Section 1:
The District constituting the seat of Government of the United States shall appoint in such manner as Congress may direct:

A number of electors of President and Vice President equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a State, but in no event more than the least populous State; they shall be in addition to those appointed by the States, but they shall be considered, for the purposes of the election of President and Vice President, to be electors appointed by a State; and they shall meet in the District and perform such duties as provided by the twelfth article of amendment.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p class="small">
Section 2:
The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.</p>

        <p class="big">The Amendment Simplified:</p>
        <div class="smallDiv">
        	<p class="small">The 23rd amendment slows the citizens of Washington D.C to vote for the President and Vice President in the Electoral College. It also allows for a non-voting representative in The House of Representatives.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <p class="big">The issue:</p>
        <div class="smallDiv">
        	<p class="small">The U.S was the only nation where the capital's citizens couldn't vote. D.C was also consider ba state in every was except for representation which caused. Many people voiced their opinions but this issue was never addressed in Congress until 1960 when Kenneth B. Keating proposed the 23rd amendment. The amendment was quickly ratified in 1962.</p>

      <div class="item">
        <p class="big">Outcome:</p>
        <div class="smallDiv">
        	<p class="small">This amendment slowed for the citizens of Washington D.C to vote for Presidents and Vice Presidents and a non-voting representative in the House of Representatives. This amendment didn't change any thing else and did not change day to day life.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <p class="big">Court Cases</p>
        <div class="smallDiv">
        	<p class="small">A rulling from the Supreme Court stated that citizens of Washington D.C could not vote for members of Congress as they are not apart of a state but a district. The 23rd amendment only menchions about voting for the President and Vice President through the Electoral College not about voting for members of Congress.

      <div class="item">
        <p class="big">People Involved</p>
        <div class="smallDiv">
        	<p class="small">James Madison stated in his federalist papers that citizens of D.C will have voting rights but they ended up being taken away. in 1888 Theodore W. Noyes wrote articles about D.C getting representation in Congress. In 1960, Kenneth B. Keating proposed the 23rd amendment causing it to be ratified in 1961.</p>

      <div class="item">
        <p class="big">Structure</p>
        <div class="smallDiv">
        	<p class="small">The 23rd amendment has two sections, Section One explains the purpose of the amendment and what it allows; Section Two states that Congress is to enforce this amendment.
          </p>

      <div class="item">
        <p class="big">Opinion</p>
        <div class="smallDiv">
        	<p class="small">We belive that this amendment only solved the niche problem is was designed to fix but a larger problem still lingers as the people of Washington D.C are not fully represented as they cannot vote for issues in Congress as D.C does not have a representative in the Senate and their representative in the House of Representatives can not vote.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="item">
        <p class="big">Ratification</p>
        <div class="smallDiv">
        	<p class="small">The Amendment was proposed in 1960 which was swiftly passed by Congress on June 16th and was ratified by Ohio on March 29th 1961. Arkansas was the only state to reject this amendment and Alabama ratified the amendment in 2002.</p>
